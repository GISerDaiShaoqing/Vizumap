About the Package
-----------------
=======
This package provides three methods for visualising uncertainty in spatial data. These approaches are based on the methods developed in Lucchesi and Wikle (2017), and
we have tried to generalise the approaches so they can be applied to most types of spatial data. We welcome any comments or suggestions about the package. Each methods is outlined below with examples.

This package provides three methods for visualising uncertainty in spatial data. These approaches are based on the methods developed in Lucchesi and Wikle (2017) and we have tried to generalise the approaches so they can be applied to most types of spatial data. We welcome any comments or suggestions about the package. Each methods is outlined below with examples.

### Bivariate colour maps

Bivariate colour maps can be created for both areal and point level data. Using a bivariate colour grid, estimates from a spatial model (e.g. mean) and the uncertainty surrounding these values (e.g. standard deviation) are mapped simulataneously. VizU allows the user to create a bivariate colour scheme by mathematically blending two single hue colour palettes and organising them on a 3 x 3 grid. Users can develop their own bivariate colour palette as well as select from some pre-prepared palettes.

Examples
--------

A vignette for the VizU package is available and contains examples relating to each of the visualisation methods.
